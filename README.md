# The Encirclement Game
Survival game with increasing difficulty. Turrets rotate around the player and increase in count after one full circle rotation. The player can shoot the incoming bullets to avoid taking damage. The goal is to reach as many rotations as possible.

Written in C++ with SFML library for user input and graphics. Personally first game built without a game engine.
